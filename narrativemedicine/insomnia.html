      <br>A story about sound.<br><br>


I was dreaming about quietness.<br>
I see quietness as a priority. I forget when the last time is for me to enjoy this kind of priority.<br><br>
<hr>
I found myself becoming sensitive to sound when I was a sophomore in college. And I started to be suffered from insomnia. Because of the noises, I couldn’t sleep.<br>
And that’s not the whole story.<br>
When I was awakened by the sound, or I was struggling to sleep or to pay attention to certain things because of the sound, I become mad and irritable.<br>
I ask myself every night, why can’t I sleep? When is the last time I sleep while in a quiet environment?<br><br>
<hr>
To anywhere I live, I hear those annoying sounds.<br>
It starts from the sound produced by a human.<br>
The sound from my roommates.<br>
The sound from the children who live upstairs.<br>
Then there are machine-generated noises following me everywhere.<br>
The sound from the street.<br>
The sound from the refrigerator.<br>
…<br>
Noises. Noises. Noises.<br><br>
<hr>
Is this world really that loud?<br>
Have I been changed or the world has been changed?<br><br>
<hr>
I remember when I sought help from a psychologist. He said that one thing I should consider is I am not just mad at the noises. I am mad at the people who are not considerate.<br>
I understand so I was trying to tell myself they do not intend to generate those sounds to interrupt my sleep. I told myself every day but I still suffered.<br>
If that’s human-generated voices, I try to talk to them.<br>
If that’s machine-generated sound, I try to talk to people who are in charge of that.<br>
But I hardly get what I want.<br><br>
<hr>
I think the only way I can free myself from noises and insomnia is just me.<br>
Besides talking to others about my feelings, I spent so much money on soundproof products.<br><br>
<hr>
Fortunately, I found earbuds which work great, though they are quite large for my ears making me a little bit uncomfortable while sleeping. But they bring me the priority I am seeking for a long time. Quietness.<br><br>
<hr>
My sound-sensitive journey continues.<br>
I miss the days when I don’t need the earbuds to sleep.<br>
I miss the days when I don’t feel anger when I hear noises during the day or night.<br><br>
